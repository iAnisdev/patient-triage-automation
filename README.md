## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- UiPath Studio
- Google Cloud Project (for ADK agent)

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. . **Run the Application**
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the application. Login with the following credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

For Patient Side, visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/booking` to access the application.

### UiPath Bots Setup

1. **Required Bots**
- `LogAppointment.xaml` - Handles appointment scheduling
- `NotifyPatient.xaml` - Manages patient notifications

2. **Bot Configuration**
- Ensure UiPath Studio is installed
- Open the project in UiPath Studio
- Configure the following settings:
  - Set the working directory to the project root
  - Configure email settings for notifications
  - Set up SMS gateway if needed

3. **Bot Usage**

**LogAppointment Bot**
- Input Parameters:
  - QueueItemId: ID of the queue item

  - Time: Appointment time
- Actions:
  - Reads appointment data
  - Creates new appointment record
  - Updates queue status
  - Sends confirmation email
  - Prints appointment slip

**NotifyPatient Bot**
- Input Parameters:
  - AppointmentId: ID of the appointment
  - NotificationType: Type of notification (confirmation/reminder/reschedule/cancellation)
- Actions:
  - Sends email notification
